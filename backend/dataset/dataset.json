      "The 5X points sound good, but you have to pay attention to the rotating categories each quarter, and it's capped at $1,500 in spending. Outside of those specific categories, you only get 1X points, which isn't amazing compared to some other cards out there. It takes effort to maximize the rewards.",
      "It's a decent card if you're already an Amalgamated Bank of Chicago customer. The no annual fee and purchase perks like extended warranty are good. However, I was disappointed there's no introductory offer for balance transfers, only for purchases. The rewards are okay, but might not be the best value depending on your spending.",
      "For a no-annual-fee card, it's straightforward. You earn points on everything. I like that I can redeem points for different things like statement credits or gift cards, not just travel. Getting the $150 welcome bonus for regular spending was a nice plus.",
      "While the 0% purchase APR for 12 months is nice, be careful after that \u2013 the regular APR can go up pretty high (up to 22.90%). Also, there's no intro APR for balance transfers, and they charge a 3% fee for transferring a balance, plus fees for cash advances. Make sure you pay it off!"

      "It's a solid card with no annual fee and a nice little 5,000 points bonus just for making your first purchase. I also appreciate the lack of cash advance fees, which many other cards charge.",
      "I was initially confused about the APR. The main section mentions a 'Fixed Annual Percentage Rate as low as 12.90%', but the details for the Aerospace offer mention a standard *variable* APR after the intro period. Also, that amazing 3-year 0% APR offer isn't for everyone, only specific Aerospace employees meeting certain conditions."

The $99 companion fare you get each year (after spending $6k) easily makes the $95 annual fee worth it.",
      "The welcome offer is currently amazing - 60,000 miles is valued at around $900 by TPG, plus you get the Companion Fare and a 30% discount code right off the bat! Alaska miles are hard to earn otherwise, so this is a great way to get a big chunk for partner awards on airlines like Cathay Pacific or JAL.",
      "While the perks for flying Alaska are good, the earning rate for everyday spending is pretty low at just 1 mile per dollar. Other travel cards offer better rewards on general purchases. Unless you are specifically targeting Alaska miles or use the bonus categories (gas, transit, streaming, etc.) heavily, you might earn more elsewhere.",
      "I was disappointed that Alaska miles aren't very flexible. Unlike Chase or Amex points, you can only use them with Alaska and its partners. While the partners are good, I prefer having more options. It's also worth noting the high regular APR if you carry a balance.",
      "For the $95 annual fee, it offers solid value, especially with the free checked bag benefit and the annual $99 Companion Fare (if you meet the $6,000 spend). The 2X miles on gas, transit, and streaming is a nice touch beyond just airline spending. Plus, no foreign transaction fees is great for international travel."

    "user_reviews": [
      "The Gold card takes sort of an opposite approach from its gaudy Platinum sibling. American Express Platinum is all about flashy benefits but doesn't offer much in the way of spending rewards. The Gold doesn\u2019t offer perks on par with premium rewards cards, nor is it as straightforward or affordable as some other dining and travel credit cards. But it's one of the best cards if you\u2019re looking for outstanding rewards at restaurants and at U.S. supermarkets. Cardholders can quickly amass points with everyday spending and then take advantage of a valuable redemption option by transferring points to a travel partner and booking a rewards flight.",
      "I love my AmEx Gold card because I have a system down where I know how and when to use my credits. (Hello, Uber Eats and Grubhub lunches!) However, AmEx hiked the annual fee and justified it with additional Dunkin' and Resy credits. Depending on where you live, those credits could be amazing or completely useless, so it's important to consider that when deciding whether this card is worth its annual fee.",
      "If you're a foodie \u2014 or you have a family \u2014 you're gonna be hard-pressed to find a better one-two punch than this card. That's because it offers rich rewards on two of the top line items in most household budgets: groceries and restaurants. There's no shortage of cards that offer high rates on one of those categories or the other. But not usually both. Now, you'll owe a significant annual fee for that, so you're also gonna want to get comfortable using the card's various offsetting credits. If you don't have time to fool with all that (or if you don't have a compelling use for AmEx Membership Rewards points), you're better off with a no-annual-fee cash-back card.",
      "AmEx is often criticized for turning its cards into expensive coupon books, and recent changes to this card follow that track. The 4X at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets is superb, but its statement credits are way too narrow to cover the high annual fee for me. I never go to Dunkin\u2019 and rarely go to qualifying Resy restaurants. Instead, I\u2019ll buy my groceries with my no-annual-fee Capital One Savor and earn 3% back, thank you very much."

      "I've been very happy with the welcome bonus and the 5x points on flights and hotels booked through Amex Travel. The customer service has also been top-notch whenever I've had a question.",
      "The sheer number of benefits can be overwhelming at first, and it takes some effort to understand and maximize them all. However, once you do, the value is definitely there, especially if you travel often.",
      "As someone who already banks and invests with Schwab, this card was a natural fit. The added benefit of the enhanced cash-out rate for rewards makes it even more appealing than the standard Amex Platinum."

If you fly a fair amount then it may be a handy thing to have.",
      "Just got the Ameriprise World Elite Mastercard. Has a $150 annual fee. One of the benefits is you get a Priority Pass Membership which gives you access to 500 airport lounges worldwide for no charge. The fine print of this benefit basically says that they can change the offer and start charging you to enter an airport lounge. This deal seems too good to be true. no other credit cards gives you free airport lounge access for this annual fee. "

      "The $250 statement credit for new cardholders is a solid welcome bonus and helps offset the annual fee in the first year.",

      "The 0% intro APR for 12 months on purchases and balance transfers is helpful, but the regular APR can be quite high depending on your creditworthiness, so it's best to pay your balance in full each month."

As long as you pay it off every month, easy card with no fees. And, approval is pretty easy (I got mine when my file was thin, it was my second CC).There are 2% cashback cards, but I am not aware of one that does not have an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee (which a 3% transaction fee eats up that 2% instantly....) Making them useless during travel. I would much rather have 1.5% and no annual fee and no foriegn transaction fee if I had to choose just one. If you don't travel a lot, then you may be willing to put up with such fees.... but I still advise against any fees.",
      "The quicksilver is as good as you can find for a catch-all rewards card with no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees. Even using domestically, the difference between the 1.5% of the QS and the 2% of other catch-all cards is pretty inconsequential for how much most people spend. Lets say you spend 10k on it in a year - the difference in rewards is $50 over the whole year vs a 2% card. But you can use it everywhere.If you don't travel abroad, I think that the 2% cards like citi doublecash, paypal mastercard, WF active cash, etc. are a better move. But if you do travel internationally, the QS is a great card.",
      "I've had a Capital One Quicksilver card for years. The cash back is better than my Navy Federal GO Rewards card. With Capital One, you can cash out 30 cents if you want. With Navy Federal you have to have 5000 points ($50) to get cash back. No annual fee on either card, but I have a lower interest rate on Navy Federal. I tend to use Capital One as my every day card but pay it off whenever I can."

      "This card has an annual fee, which is the main reason I'm rating it good and not great. I understand it's a card for people with less-than-perfect credit, and it's designed to help people build their credit, but the annual fee is a drawback for me. (Note: the fee is really reasonable compared to some of the other cards out there.) The other reason for a lower score is the excessive verification Capital One puts you through. I've had to verify my bank account several times because I make smaller, more frequent payments. It's a huge hassle to verify your banking account and get your card turned back on. It almost seems like you're being punished for making payments. Plus, with lower credit limits, smaller, more frequent payments should be expected. I understand the need to verify but once (or maybe twice) should be enough. Beyond these couple of issues, the card is good overall. It offers rewards and if you're using it for purchases you'd be making anyway, the rewards can really add up. I would recommend this card for people looking to build their credit profile and/or repair past damage.",
      "Earning a flat 1.5% cash back on all purchases is straightforward and easy to understand, which is great for someone like me who doesn't want to track bonus categories.",
      "It's good that they consider applicants with fair credit or those new to credit, making it an accessible option for building or rebuilding a credit history.",
      "The fact that there are no foreign transaction fees is a nice perk if you occasionally make purchases in foreign currencies online or while traveling.",
      "The $39 annual fee is a bit of a drawback, especially since there's no welcome bonus to offset it. You need to spend enough to earn more in cash back than the fee costs.",
      "The 29.74% variable APR is very high, so it's crucial to pay your balance in full each month to avoid significant interest charges. This card isn't ideal for carrying a balance."

It has a simple and uncomplicated rewards structure and straightforward redemption options. Plus, it\u2019s annual fee is manageable if you don\u2019t have the budget to pay for a pricier card.",
      "This card's sign-up bonus funded a family vacation to Washington, D.C., last year, and we enjoyed its simple, straightforward rewards. The card has transfer partners, but because those partners are largely international airlines, you'll need to do some homework if you want to squeeze outsize value from your rewards. I don't have the patience for that, and the fee wasn't worth paying after Year One, since any number of cards offer 2% rewards for free. But it's a great starter travel card.",
      "I love the simplicity of this card. Earning 2 miles per dollar on everything makes it easy to rack up rewards quickly, and I don't have to think about bonus categories.",
      "The sign-up bonus is excellent and definitely helps offset the annual fee in the first few years. It's a great way to start accumulating a lot of miles for a trip.",
      "Redeeming miles for statement credit against any travel purchase is incredibly flexible. I appreciate not being tied to specific airlines or hotels.",
      "While the 2x miles is good, if you're really into maximizing value through transfer partners, the lack of domestic airline partners might be a bit limiting.",
      "The $95 annual fee is reasonable for the rewards and perks you get, but if you're not a frequent traveler, a no-annual-fee cash back card might be a better option."

      "The no foreign transaction fees saved me countless times in Thailand and Vietnam. Simple 1.25x miles on everything and easy miles redemption on travel purchases make it perfect for digital nomads.",
      "Not a fan of the low 1.25% rewards rate. Other no-annual-fee cards give you 1.5% to 2% back, so it feels underwhelming unless you're specifically using it for international travel.",
      "I love that I can transfer the miles to travel partners. That's rare for a no-fee card and gives me much better value than the standard 1 cent per mile redemption.",
      "If you travel more than a couple times a year, just pay for the regular Venture. The extra 0.75% earning rate easily makes up for the $95 annual fee if you put more than $1,060 a month on your card.",
      "The lack of major U.S. airline transfer partners is frustrating. Makes it difficult to use points on domestic flights where I need them most.",
      "Great first travel card if you don't want to pay an annual fee. The sign-up bonus is easy to hit ($500 spend) and the 0% intro APR period helped me finance a vacation without worrying about interest."

      "In reality, the $300 travel credit can be used fairly broadly (I\u2019ve used it for award ticket fees, UA travel bank, among other things. And many other people have shared DP\u2019s consistent with that). Also, $150/yr retention offers are not unusual for the card. Also $0 authorized users who get their own PP/lounge access.",
      "I hold the Ritz card for one specific reason, which is its unlimited AUs with Priority Pass. The Priority Pass also includes unlimited guests. It works great as a family card. I currently have 5 AUs, all with Priority Pass accounts.",
      "The Ritz is one of the rare cards that provides at least 2x the AF in value with little to no effort. It\u2019s a no-brainer as long as you stay at Marriott properties and don\u2019t plan to apply for the Bonvoy Brilliant in the next 13 months.",
      "Hubby upgraded to the ritz and reapplied for the boundless when it was 5 50k certs earlier this year. We have made use of the priority pass pretty regularly. He also stays in marriotts 1-2 weeks a month so it\u2019s a no brainer. Also the travel credit along with the 85k cert is great. he also had the Chase sapphire reserve but it doubles up on a lot of benefits so we downgraded that to the preferred.",
      "I have the Chase Ritz and it\u2019s the best travel card ever for me.",
      "I think the Ritz Carlton is overall the better card, particularly for large purchases and travel expenses. It comes with a slew of protections that we don't find too often on other cards.",
      "I'm relatively new to the card myself, but I was able to get a travel credit applied near the end of last year by sending a secure message instead of calling. It took a couple of days (might have been over a weekend), but it worked out.",
      "You\u2019re missing that most of us who have this card value the $300 as cash. It\u2019s not hard to find data points online how to do this. It\u2019s $150 effective annual fee yearly for an 85k cert that can be worth over $1,000. Plus the PP with chase lounge access. Not to mention unlimited authorized users at no cost who get their own PP memberships with unlimited guests.",
      "I like the ritz card, you won\u2019t get the bonus nights as you already hold a personal card. You can only earn the nights from 1 personal card and 1 business card each calendar year. You can\u2019t stack the nights. If you are looking for the nights try getting the Amex business card.",
      "I think it more depends which of the two you find more value in. The CSR and CSP have the same ability to use transfer partners and the same dining multiplier. What is the effective annual fee for you and is that increase worth the extra 1x travel? For many, the ritz carlton has an easier to justify fee. I assume you're comparing the two for lounge access, and they are effectively the same for that."

      "The Chase Sapphire Preferred is a great beginner card for a moderate traveler. It has great travel protections and the ability to use points as cash back, book travel through Chase's portal, or transfer to airline and hotel programs.",
      "I got mine in May and it\u2019s definitely become one of my most used cards. Dining, online groceries, parking, Lyft, streaming services, and of course to book travel. Absolutely a keeper for me.",
      "This card is worth it if you qualify for the initial bonus and you're comfortable using your points to book travel through the card's issuer. It doesn\u2019t matter which airline or hotel you use.",
      "The catch is the card has a $95 annual fee and poor multipliers in comparison to similar cards. However, Chase has better transfer partners and you can combine it with other Chase cards to get the most from it.",
      "I think it\u2019s still worth it as a travel card. I do some spending abroad and that instantly takes the Freedom cards out of the running due to foreign transaction fees. Trip delay insurance and primary car rental insurance are probably worth more than the annual fee for a lot of people.",
      "Overall this has been a good card in terms of travel rewards, however, I was very disappointed by a recent experience where I disputed a charge from a travel service who lied to us. Chase denied the dispute despite extensive evidence.",
      "I have 200k in points on my CSP. The customer service is pretty good and chill for Sapphire. Every time I call and have to transfer to Business Cash I am treated to much rougher service.",
      "Our experience with Chase Sapphire has been unpleasant. The promoted travel benefits are part of a 'bait and switch' scam. We experienced canceled flights and delayed luggage, and our claims were denied or pending despite providing all requested documents.",
      "I think the card is worth it. Low annual fee, no foreign fees, Visa accepted everywhere, lots of travel coverages (delayed baggage, lost baggage, etc).",
      "Except for the signup bonus, I don't think it's worth it. There's a $50 hotel credit, but since you won't be staying at a hotel, it's a waste. So you're paying $95 a year for the other benefits."

      "This card helped me build my credit during college. However, the high APR after the intro period means it's important to pay off the balance in full each month.",
      "I appreciated the 0% intro APR on purchases for 7 months. It helped me manage some large expenses at the beginning of the semester.",
      "The foreign transaction fee was a downside when I studied abroad. I ended up getting a different card without foreign fees for that purpose."

Also, they are offering 6 cents per gallon and also a $30 refund after buying 100 gallons in 60 days. The only drawback is you have to pay the balance in full monthly to avoid the crazy high interest rate.",
      "I had a credit card with Exxon for over 14 years. I found out through Credit Karma Exxon closed my account out. I called Exxon and was advised that it was closed out because of no activity. It would have been nice to get a phone call or a letter advising me of the situation. When I called Exxon, I spoke to a manager named Terry who had the personality of a dish rag. They had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to re-apply! NO WAY would I do business with this company again!",
      "Great card to have when traveling! There is an Exxon at almost every exit on the highway. Most have nice places for food & coffee. Usually hot food also.",
      "10 cents off per gallon. It's ok! Overall not a bad card, just don't know how to get more rewards. Maybe need to look for a better gas card.",
      "I got remorseful after getting this card. I decided to try it once just for the heck of it. I paid at the pump one day and I watched the price per gallon on the pump roll back. I did the math and the savings I got using this card beats my 2% cash rewards general-purpose credit card!! They raised my charge limit after the first month. No problem keeping my payments up as I can pay by phone. It's still a gas card, but that's where a lot of my money goes. By using this card, I also take the load off my other cards."

      "The Fidelity Rewards Visa card was my first 2% cash back card. There is no cap on the cash you can earn, and you can deposit your rewards directly into an investment account to let them grow over time. However, the card has a minimum $25/2,500-point redemption threshold, which can be a hassle to manage. The user interface for the card\u2019s website is also not user-friendly.",
      "The card itself is great. However, if you have any issues, the customer service is very poor. When I went to redeem my points, no where on the site did it indicate that the value would be different if I opted for credit to my credit card statement vs investing it into a Fidelity fund. The former option decreased my value in half.",
      "I like Fidelity's Reward card, it's a good basic 2% rebate on everything card (if you have other accounts with Fidelity). I like that I don't need any other logins or 'apps' to access the card features. I would probably consolidate to using just that card if it offered some form of car rental CDW. It used to, but they dropped it."

      "I applied for this card a little over 2 weeks ago and got a 'need more time to review' response. So I went online to check the application status and saw that I was denied due to too many inquiries and new accounts. I understood and walked away. Last night, I read online to try the reconsideration line. I called and explained that although I have new accounts with AMEX & Chase, I opened them to strengthen my credit profile. I further explained that I have a 100% on-time payment history, all accounts are in good standing, and that I make sure that my utilization is below 30%. The rep agreed and approved my World Mastercard with an initial $3k limit. Hopefully, they increase often and the limit will be raised within a few months. I'm just happy to have it as I frequent JetBlue; it will be great to get 3x the points on travel, 2x on groceries and restaurants, and 1 point on other purchases.",
      "It's a terrible earner card outside of spend on JetBlue, but they do have bonus promotions every once in a while (earn 5x on grocery and dining spend for the first $1,500 in the next 3 months, etc.). If you and your partner are flying round-trip at least once a year with checked bags, you will be saving money with this card. It's nice because it has no foreign transaction fees and is a Mastercard, so it works widely on vacations.",
      "The JetBlue Card is a decent, albeit uninspiring, product for occasional JetBlue flyers who want to avoid an annual fee. However, most JetBlue loyalists will want to skip this card in favor of the JetBlue Plus Card. Even with an annual fee, the JetBlue Plus Card's list of more valuable benefits makes it the superior option.",
      "The JetBlue Card offers solid value potential for big spenders, but most people will consider its benefits underwhelming. While the card does offer some solid value potential for big spenders, most people will consider its benefits underwhelming.",
      "The JetBlue Card is a good credit card to consider if you have a credit score of 700 or higher and you fly frequently but not enough to justify paying an annual fee on a card. It's one of the best airline credit cards with no annual fee because it has good rewards, including an initial bonus and in-flight savings."

      "The high APR (26.99% variable) is brutal if you carry a balance. I learned this the hard way when I had an unexpected emergency expense and couldn't pay it off right away.",
      "My initial credit limit was way too low to be useful - only $300. I had to wait 6 months to get an increase, which was frustrating as a student with monthly expenses like textbooks and supplies.",
      "I've had this card for two years and while the rewards aren't the highest, the automatic credit line increases and on-time payment bonuses have really helped me establish good credit. I'm graduating with a good credit score thanks to this card."

      "I've been a member of Marine FCU for over 20 years and always had great experiences with their credit cards. The Platinum ScoreCard has competitive APRs ranging from 9.24% to 18%, which is much better than most major banks.",
      "I was disappointed with their customer service regarding my Visa Platinum. When I had an issue with unauthorized charges, it took multiple calls and branch visits to get it resolved. Other credit unions seem to have better fraud protection systems in place.",
      "The initial credit limit they offered me was lower than expected, but after 6 months of consistent payments, they automatically considered me for a credit line increase. That's something you don't always get with bigger banks.",
      "I like that this card has no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees, which made it perfect for my deployment overseas. The ScoreCard points accumulate slowly but they don't expire as long as your account remains open.",

      "One of the best features of this card is the automatic Silver status, the 15 elite nights you get every year, and your ability to earn elite nights based on your spending. This is invaluable for frequent Marriott guests working toward lifetime elite status.",
      "I thought this would be a great card for me as I stay at Marriott properties fairly often, but I was disappointed with the limited redemption options available at the category 1-5 level for the free night certificate.",
      "The card's 5x points at Marriott/Ritz-Carlton and 2x at restaurants, car rentals, and airlines has been great for my business travel. I've accumulated enough points for several weekend getaways just through regular spending.",
      "I love that Chase rushes this card to you for free if you ask. I was approved without having a Marriott Rewards account and they set everything up automatically, including enrolling me for Silver Elite status with 15 elite night credits.",
      "The card's foreign transaction fee benefit has saved me hundreds of dollars when traveling internationally. Plus, the trip cancellation insurance and trip delay insurance benefits have been clutch when travel plans went awry."

      "My secured Navy card graduated exactly 2 days after my 6th statement cut. I didn't get the 3-month credit limit increase some people mention, but I did get approved for their Platinum card with a $7.5k limit at the 3-month mark.",
      "I use this card for EVERYTHING possible, then pay it in full at the end of the month. I try not to exceed more than $2000-$3000 monthly, which has helped me build my credit significantly while earning rewards points.",
      "The graduation process is inconsistent - it can take as little as 5-6 months or as long as 18 months. When people graduate, I've typically seen limits go from $200 to $2000, though it varies based on your relationship with Navy Federal.",
      "What makes this card stand out from other secured cards is the rewards program. I earn 1 point per dollar spent and can redeem them for gift cards or merchandise. My favorite redemption was getting a $50 Best Buy gift card for 5,000 points.",
      "The automatic account reviews are great. After six months of responsible use, they review your account monthly for potential upgrades to an unsecured card, though it's not guaranteed and seems somewhat random who gets upgraded when.",
      "Having no annual fee, no foreign transaction fees, and cell phone protection makes this vastly superior to most secured cards. The only downside is you have to be military-affiliated to join Navy Federal in the first place."

      "Having to remember to activate categories every quarter is a pain. Sometimes the 5% categories are useful (like Amazon during holidays) but other times they're completely useless to me."

      "The Amex Platinum is all flash and not enough substance. Most of the credits are hard to use fully (like the Equinox credit) and the customer service quality has declined. Not worth keeping after the first year's sign-up bonus.",
      "As someone who travels internationally a lot, I find the Platinum disappointing. Many places abroad don't accept Amex, and the FHR program is overpriced compared to just booking hotels directly or through other sites.",
      "What sold me was the comprehensive travel insurance that comes with the card. Had to cancel a trip last minute for a family emergency, and Amex covered everything. The peace of mind alone is worth the annual fee.",
      "Too many hoops to jump through to maximize the value. The credits are spread across different merchants and have monthly caps. Feels like I need a spreadsheet just to keep track of everything. Moving to a simpler card next year.",
      "The status perks with Marriott and Hilton have gotten me so many room upgrades and free breakfasts. Combined with the airport lounge access, this card makes travel feel luxurious even when I'm booking economy flights."

      "This card isn't exciting - no rewards, no sign-up bonus - but it's exactly what I needed to rebuild my credit after some financial mistakes. The $0 annual fee and Capital One's decent mobile app make it hassle-free.",
      "The interface is nice and the customer service is good, but the initial credit limit they gave me was only $300 which is frustratingly low for everyday use. I can't wait to upgrade to a rewards card once my credit improves.",
      "Honestly disappointed with the Capital One Platinum. I was hoping for rewards, but there are none. The credit limit is tiny and the interest rate is ridiculously high. Only good if you have no other options due to fair credit.",
      "Great starter card for building credit. I love that it has no annual fee and no foreign transaction fees, which saved me money during international travel. Capital One's fraud protection has also been very responsive.",
      "Capital One's automatic credit line reviews every 6 months are genuinely helpful. Started with $500 and now at $2,000 after 18 months. The high interest rate doesn't matter since I never carry a balance."

      "The card gives a misleading impression of high rewards with its 4 points per dollar, but the redemption value is terrible. I have to spend $25,000 just to earn $50 worth of rewards. There are much better 1.5% or 2% flat cashback cards available.",

That's an insanely high rate, yet common, for a bank; whereas, SchoolsFirst, just like most credit unions, cap their interest rate at 18%.",

      "I am extremely happy with this VISA credit card from SDFCU. I can still increase my credit limit, even though my card should graduate to unsecured by the end of year. I am very appreciative of 11.99% interest rate; even so, I pay my bill in full each month.",
      "Absolutely horrid experience for 2-1/2 years & I'm inside the US and never tried to use it abroad. I just closed all accounts, including the secured card. The secured card promo says they'll convert it to a non-secured card if you pay on time for a year. Wrong.",
      "SDFCU offers the best credit card deal in the market: 2% cash back on everything with no maximums, no foreign transaction fee, and no annual fee. However, it comes with drawbacks: 1. Unpredictable card declines; 2. When my card was fraudulently used out of state, it required numerous calls and emails to finally resolve; 3. A limit on the number of times per month you can pay off your card.",
      "I applied for the Secured Card, they did a hard pull even though I was securing the account with 10,000 cash and planned on securing another 10,000 in the next month. I used to have a credit score over 800 and then medical issues caused me to file for a medical bankruptcy in 2015. I paid off three vehicles with no late payments and have never made a late payment on my mortgage. I was willing to lay down cash for a high balance secured card to rebuild my credit, currently using my wife's cards, Credit utilization is less than 10%, and I pay them off every month. I just like to run everything through the card and just pay the card every two weeks. My credit score is 577 Experian and 684 for both Equifax and Transunion, monthly income is currently over 10k and they still turned me down after not allowing me to upload my documents 3x then telling me they could not verify my identity when they had my drivers licence, social security card, mortgage statement and latest paystub showing two weeks earnings at 5700.00 but they still turned me down for a card backed up with a cash security deposit because I have bad credit. That's kinda the purpose of getting a secured card - you think? Don't waste your time with them - very unprofessional..."

You link a credit card that you already have to your fuel rewards account, and all qualifying purchases made on that credit card will give you fuel rewards at Shell.

This means that the rewards from this program have no negative impact on cash back/points earning while giving you .5% to 4% additional cash back on top of whatever you regularly get from your card. There is no real downside to this program. Even if you lose gold status, the floor is still $0.03 per gallon plus whatever you earn from your linked card spend.",

I also try to book Southwest hotels, leverage rapid rewards shopping and dining. My thought process was that if I do this, then I have to be all in with that one carrier to get the best bang for my buck. There\u2019s nothing nicer than paying $11.20 for a round trip flight and trading in some points.",
      "The SW Priority Card pays for itself. It has a $149 annual fee, but the card has a $75 Southwest annual travel credit and 7,500 anniversary points each year. Those two benefits alone are worth more than $149.",
      "Just having a Southwest credit card does not automatically provide you with improved boarding positions. You need to purchase either EarlyBird Check-In or upgraded boarding which may be reimbursed a certain number of times depending on which card you have.",
      "If you don\u2019t fly often then it\u2019s probably not a great card for you. I fly a decent amount (1x per month) and I don\u2019t even think it was worth it without the sign on bonuses. We got companion pass for spending x amount in the first 3 months. Although I don\u2019t think I would have signed up for anything less than that. We plan to cancel the card when the pass expires.",
      "Personally I didn\u2019t find much value in the Southwest card. I don\u2019t spend enough per year to qualify for companion pass. You can transfer points with Chase Sapphire and even book Southwest flights directly on their portal. I basically stopped using my Southwest card in favor of my Sapphire."

Marriott is just substituting the sign on bonus for the night free. If you're thrifty, you can get 2+ nights out of it. I've actually gotten rooms for 10k points."

Are flexible on your reward flights where you will use them 6. Can plan your reward flights well in advance. Otherwise realizing that .02 is not easy.

      "I think it\u2019s a great card honestly. I fly with my wife and we make up more than the annual fee if we take one trip just in the bag fees of $140. Puts us in the green right off the bat. Then you have the 2 club passes yearly which is $100 in value. Add in TSA pre check and that\u2019s a ton of value for a $95 card. $240 in value if I take just one trip a year not counting the TSA pre check. Throw in the bonus you get for opening the card and the fact that United opens up more award space to credit card holders makes this a keeper for me.",
      "I have both cards. I like the Explorer card because I check a bag 99% off the time, so that pays for itself, and I always use the lounge passes. And having access to more award ticket options is great.",
      "I travel light - never check in bags, but this card is still a winner for me. The two lounge passes alone make up for the annual fee. Also, you can save $ by flying in basic economy and, because of the card, bring your carry on for free and get priority boarding. 25% off inflight drinks/snacks/wifi doesn't hurt, either...",
      "The Explorer card comes at $95 annual fee (first year waived) but wanted to list the nice perks that it comes with that can make it a daily driver for even occasional United flyers. Priority Boarding + Free Checked Bag, 2 United Club one-time passes, Up to $100 Pre-Check / Global Entry Credit, Free 1 year DoorDash subscription, Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver (Coverage is Primary!), Trip Cancellation / Interruption Insurance, Baggage Delay Insurance, Lost Luggage Reimbursement, Trip Delay Reimbursement, Purchase Protection (Covers your new purchases for 120 days against damage or theft up to $10,000 per claim and $50,000 per year). I'd say in its class the explorer card is one of the best when it comes to its perks and is a great card to have in your arsenal, even if you are not a super frequent United flyer.",
      "Not impressed, personally. The only perks that I actually use (the two lounge passes) are basically 'second class' perks. You'll be persona non grata if you try to use one at a 'busy time of year' (and I only travel at 'busy times of year'). Some miserable, ugly 'gatekeeper' was standing guard to ensure that I didn't get in at Newark C74 lounge. I hadn't eaten all day, I was thirsty and hungry, all I wanted was to grab a sandwich and a cold drink, and sit for 15 minutes. He absolutely could have let me in but I got the old line of 'if we let you in, then we'd have to let everyone in'. I'm not sure who this 'everyone' referred to...in the 2 or 3 minutes I was there, about a dozen 'first class' people were admitted and I was the only 'second class person' barred from entry. So who this ugly mofo was referring to remains a total mystery. Quite humiliating to be turned away, in front of all those people 'swanning in' without a care in the world. United, I'm disgusted. I'll be cancelling my card ASAP. You suck. Literally SUCK.",
      "Not just busy times of the year. All year. I've had my card for over 5 years and have yet to use the club passes because of this right here. I've tried almost every year and have been turned away every time. It's infuriating! And exactly as you said, the way they treat you like a second class citizen, it's humiliating. We paid to have this benefit. Why include this if they're not going to honor it??",
      "If the pros are good, then get it. Airline cards are never good for earning points. Only good for priority boarding and checked bags. It\u2019s like paying a subscription to check in a bag."

      "The LANPASS Visa Signature card from U.S. Bank is a great option for earning extra kilometers with the program, so anyone who frequently travels to South America should consider adding it to their portfolio.",
      "The card comes with a 20,000-mile sign-up bonus after the first purchase. That\u2019s worth about 32,000 LAN kilometers. You\u2019ll also get a 4,000-mile annual bonus.",
      "You\u2019ll get 25 percent bonus kilometers and three annual upgrades on LAN flights, plus a 20 percent discount on your first LAN or TAM flight purchased every year.",
      "The LANPASS card rewards miles, but the LANPASS program uses kilometers as its currency. The miles earned on the card are worth about 1.6 kilometers.",
      "The LANPASS Visa Signature Card isn\u2019t as generous as some of its competitors; but for cardholders who travel frequently to South America, it offers some modest bonuses on airfare and a smattering of benefits, including an annual 20 percent discount on LATAM purchases and three discounted upgrades per year.",
      "There\u2019s not much going for this mediocre airline card unless you travel frequently to Latin America and prefer to fly on LATAM Air. For $75 a year, the LATAM Visa Signature Card offers a limited rewards program and a smattering of benefits \u2013 including a one-time annual discount on a flight of your choice \u2013 but few of the card\u2019s perks justify its high annual fee.",
      "You may have a hard time, though, finding a rewards-funded flight that fits your travel plans. Blackout dates may apply on trips to your desired destination. In addition, the airline also holds just a limited number of rewards-funded seats. It also restricts rewards travel to round-trip flights, so you\u2019ll have to wait until you have miles saved up before you can purchase a free flight."
